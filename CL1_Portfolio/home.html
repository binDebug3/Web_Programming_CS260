           <h3>What is the Applied and Computational Math Emphasis 
            (<a href='https://acme.byu.edu/' target="_blank">ACME</a>) at BYU?</h3>
            <p class='about-p what'>ACME is a unique and intensive intersection of advanced mathematics,
            statistics, and computer science designed to prepare people to solve
            21st century problems. As the foundation for modern technology, a deep
            understanding of mathematics enables successful algorithm design, 
            effective data analysis, and innovative solutions to modern challenges.

            <h3>Why Did I Choose ACME?</h3>
            <p class='about-p why'>When I first started my college education, I was an electrical engineer. 
            I really enjoyed my classes, but as I learned more about the possibilities
            that math enables like machine learning and data analysis from friends and 
            information sessions, I considered the idea of switching my major. It was 
            hard to let go of my plans to become an engineer, but I get so excited learning
            about the power that math has to teach a computer to learn and help us 
            understand the world better, that I knew I needed to change my direction.

          <div class='section home-text'>
            <h3>What is the Data Science and Machine Learning Concentration?</h3>
            <p class='about-p conc'>Every student in ACME chooses a concentration in addition to their regular
            math coursework. I choose Data Science and Machine Learning because my dream
            is to be able to use those tools to improve people's quality of life, help 
            people make better decisions, and allow people to work more efficiently. 
            So, in addition, to my normal classes, I am also taking severl classes on 
            statistics, computer science, and machine learning techniques.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p class='about-p hs'>I am the oldest of four siblings. I grew up in 
            Alameda, California until I started high school when my family and I 
            moved over the hills to Danville, California.  I loved high school because 
            I got stretch myself every single week. I played piano a few hours each week,
            trained with my Track and Cross Country team every day, and participated in 
            my school's leadership program for three years. My senior year I put myself
            out of my comfort zone by joining the school's choir and FIRST robotics team.</p>
